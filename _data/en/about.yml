    Hi! I'm a Software Engineer with 10+ years of experience specializing in building high-load fault-tolerant systems.
    
    I have hands-on experience with multiple programming languages and technologies including C#, .NET, JavaScript, Go, SQL and NoSQL databases.
    
    I'm also proficient in DevOps and cloud technologies like Kubernetes and Docker.
    
    **My core stack:** C#, .NET Core, JavaScript, Go, Microservice Architecture
    
    **Deep expertise in:**
    - API development and optimization
    - Event-driven system design
    - Payment systems and banking protocols integration
    - Database development and optimization
    - CI/CD and DevOps practices
    - Microservices architecture design and implementation
    - Complex business process implementation using SAGA patterns
    
    I value clean code, unit testing and well-thought architecture in my work.
    I strike a balance between performance and development velocity.
    I actively use design patterns, SOLID principles and AI-powered coding assistants in my workflow.
